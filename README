spotishmote.sh v0.2

Spotishmote is a simple bash-script that lets you control the Spotify-client that runs native under Linux. dbus-send must be available on the system for the script to function.

For the option x to work, you need to have xclip installed

It's handy to use in conjunction with keyboard shortcuts.

If you have any questions or comments about the script, don't hesitate to contact me:
