spotishmote.sh v0.1

Spotishmote is a simple bash-script that lets you control the Spotify-client that runs native under Linux. dbus-send must be available on the system for the script to function.

It's handy to use in conjunction with keyboard shortcuts.

If you have any questions or comments about the script, don't hesitate to contact me:
